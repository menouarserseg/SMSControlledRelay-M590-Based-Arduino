I bought this module at AliExpress, which was a little big but it did the job.
I took some time trying to figure out what does each Pin represent after some tries I found it and I have drew all the connections in the picture attached. This module based on Neo M590 needs a 4.7v power source so you might consider using a voltage drop-down module or you can use directly 5v from arduino but you will have to change it later to save your chip from damage. I actually used a 1N4007 diode that drops 0.7v from the 5v source.
You will notice that I rexecuted the same commands two times after 2 seconds each, that's because of the quality of the model which is the first version, it did the job anyway.
The led on pin 11 lights turns off when the model is ready. 
The device will wait for a call after start listening for sms messages, when you send "open" on a sms to the sim card, it will set on the LED in pin 10 and the same for the relay model in pin 7.
To turn off you can send "close".
After both operations the model will call you as a confirmation of the reception of the command, you can change your phone number by changing number on "atd0664133630;" in all lines.
